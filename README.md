Iterative update-oriented text mining and sentiment analysis in games -- taking Genki Knight as an example
Abstract
With the continuous development and increasing competition in the mobile gaming market, game iteration and updates have become critical factors in maintaining competitiveness and user engagement. In this context, sentiment analysis of game user reviews has emerged as a vital tool for understanding player needs, optimizing game experience, and guiding game iteration and updates. This study takes "Genki Knight" on the Taptap gaming platform as an example and utilizes text mining and sentiment analysis with Python and R languages to explore sentiment analysis methods and practices oriented towards game iteration and updates. Firstly, a large volume of game review data is obtained through web scraping techniques, followed by preprocessing and feature extraction using natural language processing techniques. Subsequently, a sentiment analysis system based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models is established to accurately predict the sentiment of game reviews through training and validation. Finally, by interpreting and analyzing the results of sentiment analysis, valuable insights are provided for game iteration and updates. This study not only offers guidance for game developers to optimize the gaming experience but also provides suggestions for game platform operators to enhance their management strategies, thereby offering practical significance and promotional value.
